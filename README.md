## Problem Title
SIH 25010: Smart Crop Advisory System for Small and Marginal Farmers
## Problem Description
A majority of small and marginal farmers in India rely on traditional knowledge, local shopkeepers, or guesswork for crop selection, pest control, and fertilizer use. They lack access to personalized, real-time advisory services that account for soil type, weather conditions, and crop history. This often leads to poor yield, excessive input costs, and environmental degradation due to overuse of chemicals. Language barriers, low digital literacy, and absence of localized tools further limit their access to modern agri-tech resources.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

Helping small farmers make informed decisions can significantly increase productivity, reduce costs, and improve livelihoods. It also contributes to sustainable farming practices, food security, and environmental conservation. A smart advisory solution can empower farmers with scientific insights in their native language and reduce dependency on unreliable third-party advice.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual, AI-based mobile app or chatbot that provides real-time, location-specific crop advisory.
• Soil health recommendations and fertilizer guidance.
• Weather-based alerts and predictive insights.
• Pest/disease detection via image uploads.
• Market price tracking.
• Voice support for low-literate users.
• Feedback and usage data collection for continuous improvement.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Small and marginal farmers
• Agricultural extension officers
• Government agriculture departments
• NGOs and cooperatives
• Agri-tech startups

Supporting Data

• 86% of Indian farmers are small or marginal (NABARD Report, 2022).
• Studies show ICT-based advisories can increase crop yield by 20–30%.

## Proposed Solution
<p>Our solution is unique because it blends cutting-edge AI with grassroots accessibility, ensuring that even the smallest and least digitally literate farmers can benefit from scientific, data-driven insights. Unlike existing advisory services that are generic and language-limited, our platform delivers hyper-local, multilingual, and voice-enabled guidance in real time. By combining soil health analysis, weather forecasting, image-based pest detection, and market intelligence into a single farmer-friendly app, we create a one-stop ecosystem that empowers farmers to make confident decisions. The innovation lies not just in technology, but in its localization, inclusivity, and continuous learning model, making it scalable across diverse geographies while directly addressing the everyday challenges of smallholder farmers.</p>

## Technical Approach
<p>Our solution adopts a robust technical approach combining AI, mobile technologies, and cloud infrastructure. The mobile app will be developed using Java/Kotlin or React Native to ensure accessibility on low-end Android devices, with a voice-enabled multilingual chatbot built on frameworks like Rasa or Dialogflow. AI models trained using TensorFlow/PyTorch will power pest and disease detection through image uploads and generate predictive insights based on soil, weather, and crop data. The backend, built with FastAPI/Flask, will integrate real-time datasets such as mandi prices and weather APIs, hosted on cloud platforms (AWS/Firebase/Azure) for scalability. A continuous feedback loop from farmers will refine the models and recommendations over time. The process flow is simple: farmers provide inputs via voice, text, or images → the system processes data using AI and external APIs → personalized advisories are delivered instantly in the farmer’s local language.</p>

## Feasibility and Viability
<p>The proposed solution is highly feasible given the increasing penetration of smartphones and mobile internet in rural India, along with the availability of cloud infrastructure and open agricultural datasets. While potential challenges such as low digital literacy, language barriers, limited connectivity, and farmer trust may hinder adoption, these can be addressed through a simple voice-enabled interface, support for regional languages, offline features, and partnerships with government bodies, NGOs, and cooperatives. Continuous farmer feedback and training programs will further improve trust, usability, and accuracy, ensuring the solution remains both viable and scalable in the long run.</p>

## Impact and Benefits
<p>The solution will directly benefit small and marginal farmers by providing personalized, real-time guidance that improves crop yield and reduces input costs. It creates social impact by empowering farmers with localized, voice-enabled advisory in their own language, reducing dependence on guesswork or middlemen. Economically, it enhances profitability through efficient resource use and better access to market prices. Environmentally, it encourages sustainable farming by minimizing excessive chemical usage and conserving natural resources. Overall, the solution strengthens rural livelihoods, promotes food security, and supports long-term agricultural resilience.</p>
